# HW1: Meta learning with MANN

[Original](http://cs330.stanford.edu/material/hw1_updated.zip) with omniglot dataset

Since I'm not familiar with TF, I try to implement Problem 2 in pytorch. I also loaded all images into RAM for faster IO
- [x] Problem 1: Data Processing for Few-Shot Classification
- [x] Problem 2: Memory Augmented Neural Networks [2, 3]
    - [x] Implement in Pytorch
    - [ ] Refactor DataLoader
    - [ ] Refactor episode phase and predict phase
